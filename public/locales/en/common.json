		"intro": "PartnerSOS empowers users to share their location with their partners instantly when they feel unsafe. Unlike apps like Messenger or Snapchat, PartnerSOS requires only a single tap, ensuring a quick and efficient notification process. Upon activation, the partner receives an SMS containing a link to view the user's location via a web app. The location updates in real-time and can be accessed directly in Google Maps for precise navigation. This streamlined approach ensures that users can seek assistance quickly and effortlessly, especially in stressful situations.",
		"inspirationHeader": "Inspiration",
		"inspiration": "The idea for PartnerSOS stemmed from a personal experience involving a friend. This friend was walking home after work when they noticed a customer following them. While not feeling threatened enough to call the police, they wanted their partner to be aware of their situation immediately. This incident highlighted the need for a simple yet effective way to share one's location, even if cellular data is turned off.",
		"developmentHeader": "Development",
		"development": "As a developer, I recognized the potential to create a fast and reliable solution. PartnerSOS is built using Expo Go and Firebase.",
		"expoGoDetails": "A React Native framework that accelerates app development by providing robust developer tools.",
		"firebaseDetails": "A suite of cloud-based development tools that aid in building, deploying, and scaling mobile apps. I utilized Firebase Authentication, Firestore DB, and Cloud Functions.",
		"experienceHeader": "Experience",
		"experience": "Developing PartnerSOS was a rewarding endeavor, especially since my background is primarily in web development. Leveraging React Native allowed me to apply my web development skills (JSX, TSX) to create a mobile app. Regardless of its popularity, this project provided invaluable experience in mobile app development."
